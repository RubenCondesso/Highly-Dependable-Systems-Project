### About

This project has 2 parts:

  1.  The goal of the project, in part 1, is to create a Highly Dependable Notary application (HDS Notary). The main goal of the HDS Notary is to certify the transfer of ownership of arbitrary goods between users.
  
  2. The goal of the second stage of the project is to extend the implementation of the first stage to tolerate the possibility that the system may be subject to Byzantine faults, affecting both the notary and users’ processes.
